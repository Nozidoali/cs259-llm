Grad A: OK , we 're on .
Professor B: Yeah .
Grad A: So , I think this is gonna be a pretty short meeting because I have four agenda items , three of them were requested by Jane who is not gonna be at the meeting today .  So . {vocalsound} The uh first was transcription status . Does anyone besides Jane know what the transcription status is ?
PhD F: Um , sort of , I do , peripherally .
PhD C: Is that English ?
PhD F: Um {disfmarker} Well first of all with IBM I got a note from Brian yesterday saying that they finally made the tape for the thing that we sent them a {pause} week or week and a half ago
PhD D: That 's our system .
Grad A: Ugh !
PhD F: and that it 's gone out to the transcribers and hopefully next week we 'll have the transcription back from that .
Grad A: C can I have a pen ?
PhD F: Um {disfmarker} Jane seems to be um moving right along on the transcriptions from the ICSI side . She 's assigned , I think probably five or six m more meetings .
PhD C: Yeah , I think we 're up to MR thirteen or something .
PhD D: Mmm .
PhD F: Yeah , so um , I guess she 's hired some new transcribers
PhD D: Speaking {disfmarker}
Grad E: Which meetings is she transcribing ?
PhD F: and {disfmarker} Um well we 've {disfmarker} we 've run out of E D Us because a certain number of them are um , sort of awaiting to go to IBM .
Grad E: OK .
PhD C: For IBM , yeah .
PhD D: Hmm .
Grad E: OK .
PhD F: and the rest are in process being transcribed uh here .
PhD D: So does she have transcribers right now who are basically sitting idle because there 's no data back from IBM
Grad E: So we 're doing some in parallel .
Grad A: Yep .
PhD F: No .
Grad A:

...
Professor B: Yeah .
PhD D: OK .
PhD F: OK .
Professor B: Yeah , thirty hours is like a hundred and ten thousand uh seconds . Uh , so that 's like eleven {disfmarker} eleven million frames . And a two thousand hidden unit net is uh I guess about seven , eight hundred thousand parameters . So that 's probably {disfmarker} That 's probably fine . I mean a four thousand is well within the range that you could benefit from but the two thousand 'd be faster so {disfmarker}
PhD D: Right . I actually have to go .
Professor B: Alright .
PhD D: So .
Professor B: Uncle Bernie 's rule is ten to one . Bernie Woodrow 's Rule of {disfmarker} yeah {disfmarker} Uncle Bernie {disfmarker} yeah .
