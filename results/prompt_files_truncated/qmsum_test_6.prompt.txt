Grad E: I guess .
Grad A: OK , we 're on . So just make sure that th your wireless mike is on , if you 're wearing a wireless .
Grad E: Check one . Check one .
Grad A: And you should be able to see which one {disfmarker} which one you 're on by , uh , watching the little bars change .
Grad B: So , which is my bar ? Mah ! Number one .
Grad A: Yep .
Grad E: Sibilance . Sibilance .
Grad A: So , actually , if you guys wanna go ahead and read digits now , as long as you 've signed the consent form , that 's alright .
Grad E: Are we supposed to read digits at the same time ?
Grad A: No . No .
Grad E: Oh , OK .
Grad A: Each individually . We 're talking about doing all at the same time but I think cognitively that would be really difficult . {vocalsound} To try to read them while everyone else is .
Grad E: Everyone would need extreme focus .
Grad A: So , when you 're reading the digit strings , the first thing to do is just say which transcript you 're on .
Professor C: Other way . We m We may wind up with ver We {disfmarker} we may need versions of all this garbage .
Grad B: For our stuff . Yeah .
Professor C: Yeah .
Grad A: Um . So the first thing you 'd wanna do is just say which transcript you 're on .
Professor C: Yeah .
Grad A: So . You can see the transcript ? There 's two large number strings on the digits ? So you would just read that one . And then you read each line with a small pause between the lines . And the pause is just so the person transcribing it can tell where one line ends and the other begins . And I 'll give {disfmarker} I 'll read the digit strings first , so can see how that goes . Um . Again , I 'm not sure how much I should talk about {pause} stuff before everyone 's here .
Professor C: Mmm . Well , we have one more coming .
Grad A:

...
} on reality
Grad D: Right . Mm - hmm .
Grad B: but sort of on your intuition of you know , " Aha ! This is maybe a sign for that ,

Grad F: Mm - hmm .
Grad B: and this is maybe a sign for this . "
Grad D: Mm - hmm .
Grad E: Mm - hmm .
Grad F: So , yeah . Later this week we should sort of get together , and sort of start thinking about that , hopefully .
Grad B: Talk features . Yep .
Professor C: OK . We can end the meeting and call Adam , and then we wanna s look at some filthy pictures of Heidelberg . We can do that as well .
Grad B: Well they had {disfmarker} they used the ammunition {disfmarker} They stored the ammunition in that tower .
Professor C: Uh , is that OK ?
Grad B: And that 's why , when it was hit by uh , a cannon ball , it exploded .
Professor C: Alright . Oh . Ni
Grad E: It exploded . That 's why they call it the Powder - Tower .
Grad B: Ahh .
Grad E: OK . I first thought it had something to do with the material that it {disfmarker} w that 's why I asked .
Grad D: That 's right , OK .
Grad B: Mmm .
