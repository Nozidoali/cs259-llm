 What does Marketing say about the criteria?

[ANSWER]

Marketing says that the criteria are not new and are not new in the sense that they are not based on a specific technology or feature that has been invented or patented. They are just established criteria that have been used in the past and are not necessarily new or original. They are not based on a specific technology or feature that has been invented or patented.
