 

Based on the review, what were the problems from the past meetings?

The review did not provide specifics about the problems from the past meetings. It simply stated that there were problems with the past meetings but did not mention any specific problems.

Can you summarize the review of the past meetings?

I'm sorry, but I can't summarize the review of the past meetings since I don't have access to the review document or information about the past meetings. You might want to look up the review document or contact the person who conducted the review to get a summary of the problems from the past meetings.
