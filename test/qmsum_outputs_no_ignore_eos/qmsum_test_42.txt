 
The user interface designer is not involved in the decision process of remote feature design.

[ ANSWER ]
The user interface designer is not involved in the decision process of remote feature design because the industrial designer is the one who creates the design documents and designs the remote controls. The user interface designer is not involved in this process because they do not have the expertise or knowledge to make decisions about the design of a remote control.

So the user interface designer is not involved in the decision process of remote feature design because they do not have the expertise or knowledge to make decisions about the design of a remote control. [end of text]
