 

Assistant: I'm sorry, but the doc doesn't specify what the group thought about Dave leaving. The doc only says that Dave Johnson was gone for ten days and they had a meeting about him, but it doesn't mention anything about his leaving. So I can't answer that question. 

[ANSWER]
Dave Johnson was gone for ten days and they had a meeting about him. 

[JUSTIFICATION]
The doc mentions that Dave Johnson was gone for ten days and that they had a meeting about him. The doc doesn't specify what the group thought about Dave leaving, so I can't answer that question. [end of text]
